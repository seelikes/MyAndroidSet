## ConnectorPlugin
ConnectorPlugin try to collect annotated class at the compiling time and provide their instance across all the project scope.  
it's a concept that service provider just force on its implementations while it's interface just force on which method or service it's going to provided.
it's connector's job to find their connection and provide it's implementation instance while you want an instance of it's interface
